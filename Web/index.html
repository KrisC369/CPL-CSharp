    <h1>C# versus Java</h1>

    <p class="lead">A discussion by socratic questioning.</p>
</div>

<p>For the class Gigantic Software Project Development, an assignment for groups of 3 was given to the students.
    The assignment consisted of creating a program for simulating amusements parks, while keeping in mind all of
    the safety regulations and pricing details. The implementation could be done in any programming language of
    choice. However, another part of the assignment was to fully explain why that particular programming
    language was chosen. Moe, Larry and Curley formed a team and started a discussion on which programming
    language they would be using. Bearing in mind that they should have to document exactly why they chose the
    programming language, the discussion got rather long.

</p>

<p id="joke"><img src="img/joke.jpg" class="img-polaroid"></p>

<p>Moe would like to use <strong>C#</strong> as he is quite an
    expert in it. Larry on the other hand, thinks they should stick to <strong>Java</strong> as it is the
    programming
    language they know well by practicing it in other courses during the last 4 years. Curley does not really
    care what programming language is used, as long as the program can be written down easily in it. What
    follows is the discussion, where names in front of a paragraph or question depict who said what.
</p>


<hr class="bs-docs-separator">

<h4>When and why was C# developed?</h4>

<p>In 1972, a programming language called C was designed by Dennis Ritchie and in 1983 it was augmented by
    Bjarne Stroustrup with type checking and classes. This language was named C with Classes and it became
    known, along with some other new features, as C++ in 1984. The Sun Microsystems people in 1990 did not like
    C or C++, so they excluded some of the features like multiple inheritance, pointers, structs, enum types,
    operator overloading and a goto statement. Therefore making it a smaller, a simpler and especially a more
    reliable programming language called Java. Then, in July 2000, Microsoft announced the programming language
    C# because they disagreed with Sun Microsystems about the removal of all those features available in C++,
    except for multiple inheritance. Therefore, C# is very close to C++. It borrows mosts of its statements,
    keywords and operators directly from C++.
</p>

<p>One can thus see C# as an advance over both C++ and Java, because it offers an alternative to the difficult
    C++ programming language but also an alternative for Java programmers who are missing features of C and C++.
    Another reason for the development of C# was to provide a language for component-based software
    development.
</p>

<h4>So, does C# support modularity better than Java?</h4>

<p>An important aspect of software development when talking about modularity is the ability to compartmentalize
    your code and to import different libraries.
    C# provides the functionality of referencing namespaces which are basically scopes for arbitrary sections of
    code. In Java one can import certain classes. The main difference between the using statement from c# and
    the import statement from Java is the fact that you can’t immediately use a single class in c#. You always
    have to use the namespace. To compare this with Java, a namespace looks and behaves more like a Java package
    and the using statement would correspond to the import wildcard in Java. Java imports with wildcards is
    generally frowned upon by the Java community though, as this can lead to unnecessary imports and a less
    clean dependency scheme. If you try to use the using directive on a specific class (say Card) like
    this:
</p>

        <pre class="brush: csharp;">
            using Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

<p>
    the compiler generates the following error: “‘Sorting.Card’ is a type, not a namespace. A using namespace
    directive can only be applied to namespaces.”
    If you want to use the Card class in a C# project, than you would need to import the whole namespace
    Sorting. In java this would correspond to:
</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.*;
        </pre>

<p>while in Java you can alternatively do</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

<h4>All those preceding languages must have made influences on the C# programming language, haven’t they?</h4>

<p>
    Indeed they did. To give you a concrete example, look at the difference in syntax when implementing an
    interface. In Java you use the implements keyword in your class declaration, because Java was influenced by
    Smalltalk. C# however uses the colon : which is close to the C++ syntax.
</p>

<p>
    Not only are there direct influences from Java and C++, but also from programming languages like Delphi and
    Visual Basic. The former is because the lead designer of C# is Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish software engineer,
    and he is also known for the programming language Delphi. The latter is because Visual Basic is also a .NET
    language.
</p>

<h4>For what is C# used?</h4>

<p>
    C# is used for a variety of software, ranging from command line utilities to phone applications. The latter
    is especially the case with the release of Windows Phone in 2010. Windows Phone is a mobile operation system
    and C# is the most popular programming language to use when building apps for Windows Phone.
</p>

<p>
    C# is also the center language for Windows developers in general. You can make desktop applications with it.
    Here, C# distinguishes between two types of applications: Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation
    (WPF). The latter is newer than the former. Both allow to create controllers like menus and buttons, but the
    latter gives more power and flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    C# can also be used for applications in embedded systems, games and website. The latter can be defined in
    more detail into two categories. The first being the web applications and the second being the web services.
    Web applications can use the ASP.NET technology to create dynamic webpages. Powerful web services can also
    be made with C# to exchange data.
</p>

<p>
    But be aware. C# applications may be intended to be careful with resources such as memory and processing
    power requirements, but the language was not created in order to compete directly, on performance and size,
    with C or an assembly language.
</p>

<h4>Has C# changed since its initial release?</h4>

<p>
    Like any other programming language, C# also evolved over time since its initial release, referred as C#
    1.0, in February 2002. The next version, C# 2.0, was released in November 2005 and includes features like
    generics and nullable types. Two year later, C# 3.0 was released. It mainly added functionality regarding a
    query language called Language Integrated Query (LINQ) for the .NET framework. Other examples of features in
    this update were extension and partial methods. In April 2010, C# 4.0 was released and was focused around
    interoperability. The latest version as of writing, C# 5.0, was released in August 2012 and its main
    features are asynchronous programming and caller information.
</p>

<h4>Are there syntax differences between Java and C#?</h4>

<p>
    What better way to start note some syntactical differences between two programming languages than by writing
    the famous “Hello, World!” program in each of them. In C# we write:
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
    namespace Hello {
        public class HelloInCSharp
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                System.Console.WriteLine ("Hello, World!");
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>And this the Java equivalent: </p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
    package hello;
    public class HelloInJava
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
    Wait a minute, are there really noticeable differences? Indeed, C# follows the same syntax as Java, but it
    is a tiny bit different. The class declarations for this example are the same for both C# and Java.
</p>

<p>
    When we have a closer look at the main method, we see an uppercase m for the main method in C#, but a
    lowercase m in Java. Indeed, C# uses UpperCamelCase (also called PascalCase) for method names, while Java
    uses lowerCamelCase.
</p>

<p>
    The next difference is the writing of the string type. Java uses a capital letter while C# does not.
    Actually, one can write the string type in C# with a capital letter, because string is just an alias for
    System.String. Then we have the actual implementation of the main method, where we again see that C# uses
    the UpperCamelCase notation while Java uses lowerCamelCase.
</p>

<p>
    Last but not least, we note the difference between a namespace in C# and package in Java. In Java it is just
    one line of code, while in C# the code within that namespace is surrounded with a block.
</p>

<h4>What does Java have that C# does not? What are the limitations?</h4>

<p>
    A big advantage of Java over C# is that Java is open source. There are a lot of IDEs to write Java code in, and
    lots of them are free as well (e.g. Eclipse). For C#, developers are mostly bound to Microsoft’s Visual Studio,
    which costs more than 600 euros (for the professional version).
</p>

<p>
    Apart from that, the Java virtual machine (JVM) is installed on most of the hardware these days. The JVM is not
    bound to one operating system. Instead, it can be used on Microsoft’s Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This also
    contributes to why the group of Java developers is greater than the group of C# developers. When developing programs
    in Java, companies can target larger groups of people than if the program would be developed in C#.
</p>

<h4>If I recall correctly, there was something called the Mono project. Does this not solve the issues of C# not being
    able to run on a machine that has no Microsoft’s Visual Studio?</h4>

<p>
    Indeed, there is an open-source, cross-platform project called the Mono project. Miguel de Icanza from Ximian
    believed that .NET had the potential to increase programmer productivity and began investigating if a linux version
    was feasible. However, the Mono team was not big enough to create a full product. Therefore, the project was made
    open-source and thus free.
</p>

<h4>Does Mono has limitations in comparison to Microsoft’s Visual Studio?</h4>

<p>
    The last release of Mono was Mono 3.0. This release included features from C# 5.0. There are only a few features of
    C# that are not included in Mono. What is missing most are System.Management, which can not be mapped to linux, and
    the async pipeline. The latter needs a parallel processing pipeline with async support. This is not (yet?)
    implemented in Mono.

</p>

<h4>Okay, apart from the business perspective, are there any other Java features and C# limitations?</h4>

<p>
    Another feature of Java is that enumerations are actually full classes. They can implement interfaces, have private
    constructors, have multiple fields of various types, etc. In C#, enumerations are mostly just named integers. They
    cannot implement interfaces. Also, enums in C# cannot be extended and are not typesafe.
</p>

<p>
    Instance initializers, as depicted in the code below, are a handy Java feature that allows a programmer to
    initialize some fields outside a constructor or a method. The only way to accomplish this behavior in C# is by
    creating a private constructor without parameters, which initializes the instances. This is not a good option since
    this cancels out the use of constructors without parameters and if there are a lot of constructors for the class,
    all of them have to call the private constructor. In C#, instances are mostly initialized in a constructor or at the
    variable’s declaration point.
</p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
    private int myInt;
    private double myDouble;
    private char theLetterC;

    {
        myInt = 0;
        myDouble = 3.1415926535;
        theLetterC = ‘c’;
    }
</pre>

<p>
    Also handy for a programmer, are unchecked exceptions. This is a feature that again, is not in C#. Unchecked
    exceptions allow the programmer to forget about catching exceptions in a method. Instead, the programmer can declare
    an unchecked exception in the signature of the method, alerting all methods that call the method that might throw an
    unchecked exception. The other methods have the possibility to surround the method call with a
    try-catch-construction, or also declare an unchecked exception in their signature. In C#, one has to explicitly
    write try-catch statements and check whether exceptions are thrown manually.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes it might be necessary for a static member to be imported. In C#, this is not possible, though some people
    state it can be done by forging static members from a raw intermediate language. In Java, static imports are allowed
    and used quite often. An example of static members that can be imported quite easily this way, is the Math class in
    Java.
</p>

<p>
    Also, Java offers some nice features that are not in C#. One of these are soft and phantom references, which make
    the life of the garbage collector a bit easier.
</p>

<h4>Stop right there! What are soft and phantom references?</h4>

<p>
    Soft references in Java can be used to implement memory-sensitive caches. An object which is weakly reachable will
    be discarded at the next garbage collection cycle. Soft references can be left as is, and will be discarded when
    memory is needed instead of just at the end of the garbage collection cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Phantom references can be used to perform pre-garbage collection. Objects are phantomly referenced after they are
    finalized. Phantom references get collected in the references queue as other references do, but the phantom
    references can still be used to clean up after finalizations. Phantom references were introduced to replace the
    finalize-construct, which heavily slows down the execution.
</p>

<h4>So why shouldn’t we use Java? What are the advantages of C#?</h4>

<p>
    In some ways, C# code is more compact than Java code. For instance, implementing an interface is done by adding a
    colon between the class and the interface to implement. When implementing an interface or extending a class in Java,
    you use the keyword <code>extends</code> and <code>implements</code>, but in C# you just use a colon. Thus in Java
    one writes <code>Cat extends Animal</code>, but in C# one writes <code>Cat : Animal</code>. C# also allows compact
    getters and setters, whereas Java requires a programmer to fully type the getter and setter methods. Another
    difference is when you write a switch statement in C#, a break is mandatory for each case.
</p>

<p>
    When it comes to conversions, C# has more to show than Java. A programmer is able to use implicit as well as
    explicit conversions in C#. In Java, only explicit conversions are possible. Sometimes, just returning an object
    might not be enough. For this purpose, C# allows a programmer to output parameters to methods. This isn’t possible
    in Java. C# does not require all arguments of a method or function to be used, meaning some can be optional. There
    is no such thing as optional parameters in Java. C# allows more kinds of methods than Java. For instance, there are
    generator methods in C#.
</p>

<p>
    Delegates are also an example of how C# can be more compact than Java. A programmer is allowed to write more public
    classes in one file when using C#. In Java, this is not the case, as the class name must be equal to the file name,
    making it impossible to get two public classes in one file. For this purpose, C# uses different access modifiers
    than Java. Another issue with Java is that one mostly needs to write full method names, whereas in C# the programmer
    is able to overload operators. This can be very handy.
</p>

<h4>
    Woow, that are a lot of differences. I am curious about all of those. Let me go more into detail. What is operator
    overloading exactly and why should you use it?
</h4>

<p>
    The best way to illustrate what operator overloading is and what the benefit is, is by starting with some C# code.
    We have a <code>Matrix</code> class that represents a matrix. We can for example add matrices in mathematics. To
    implement this, we add methods to the <code>Matrix</code> class. Using these methods result in the code below.
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
Matrix m1,m2;
Matrix result = m1.Add(m2);
</pre>

<p>
    This is ok, but wouldn’t it be more clear if you could write the following line of code instead?
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
Matrix result = m1 + m2;
</pre>

<p>
    Off course the latter code is preferred as it is more readable and natural. Lets go a bit further. Which one of the
    following lines of code below do you prefer?
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
Matrix result1 = m1.Add(m2.Add(m3.Add(m4);
Matrix result2 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4;
</pre>

<p>
    Here again, the latter is preferred because it is easier to work with. We can now start with the real job that is
    operator overloading. Have a closer look at the following example code:
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
Matrix result3 = m1 + m2;
Matrix result4 = m1 + 5;
</pre>

<p>
    The latter expression could be defined as “add 5 to each element of the matrix”. So here we are overloading the +
    operator with different argument types. We can conclude that operator overloading let us give a new meaning to
    operators.
</p>

<h4>So how does it work in C#? </h4>

<p>
    Indeed, I only showed how you can use it, but not how you implement it. I will continue the previous example. It is
    very straightforward. Just like writing your own methods, you write multiple methods with the same operator, but
    with different argument types and you also use the <code>operator</code> keyword followed by the operator. The
    following lines of code will illustrate this.
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
class Matrix
{
	// ...

	public static Matrix operator +(Matrix m1, Matrix m2)
	{
		// implementation
		// add m1 and m2
	}

    public static Matrix operator +(Matrix m1, int n)
	{
		// implementation
	// add n to each element in m1
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Like I said, it’s just that simple.</p>

<h4>How does it work in Java?</h4>

<p>
    The answer to this question is very short: it can’t be done. The only thing that comes close to operator overloading
    in Java is the operator <code>+</code>. You can use it to add up two numbers, but you also use it for string
    concatenation like show in the following example code:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
int x = 5 + 5; // adding up two numbers
String result = "x = " + x; // string concatenation
</pre>

<h4>Why isn’t it included in Java?</h4>

<p>
    There are two reasons why the Java people did not include operator overloading. The first and also the main raison
    is the compiler complexity. The second reason was just a personal choice made by James Gosling, the creator of Java
    who believed that adding operator overloading would not comply with the clean mindness of Java.
</p>

<h4>I’ve heard that you can use operator overloading to convert to and from other types, is that correct?</h4>

<p>
    You are correct and it is also very natural like the following example code. Instead of writing the first line of
    code, one can write the second line that does the same thing.
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
MyStruct myStruct1 = new MyStruct(5);
MyStruct myStruct2 = 5;
</pre>

<p>
    The inverse of this mechanism is the following code, which is also very straightforward to write and understand:
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">
int i = myStruct2;
</pre>

<p>
    As you probably guessed, <code>i</code> will be equal to 5. To implement this, it is the same as in the previous
    question.
</p>

<h4>I do not understand, where does this operator overloading happen?</h4>

<p>
    Well, here the operator overloading is on the <code>=</code> operator. You can see that on the same object type,
    this operator is used on the first line to just assign a value to the variable. On the second line however, it is
    used as a special constructor, like I indicated with colors.
</p>

<h4>I remember you talking about implicit and explicit conversions. What are they actually?</h4>

<p>
    Conversions, whether they are implicit or explicit, are ways of converting an object to an object of a different
    type. Sometimes it happens that a certain function or method expects an object of a certain type, but you only have
    an object of another (albeit similar) type available.
</p>

<p>

    There are two main ways of effecting such a conversion, namely implicitly or explicitly. Explicit conversion is the
    most basic way of converting an object of type A to an object of type B. This is often done by calling a method on
    the first object which returns an object of type B. This example shows how explicit conversion is done in java.
</p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
Double d = new Double(2.0);
double d2 = d.doubleValue();
</pre>

<p>
    Implicit conversions are a bit more subtle than explicit conversions in the way that they occur whenever they need
    to without the programmer actually having to explicitly state the conversion.
</p>

<p>
    The conversion method should just be available in the code somewhere and whenever an object of type A is provided
    where type B is needed, this method is automatically used to perform the conversion, often without the programmer
    noticing. This is a very handy mechanism for keeping the amount of code to write to a minimum when converting
    between types.
</p>

<p>
    But in short, explicit conversion is explicitly telling the program to do a conversion and implicit conversion is
    having the program do it automatically.
</p>

<h4>So Java doesn’t have any form of this implicit conversion?</h4>

<p>
    Well, that’s not exactly true either. Since Java version 1.5, Java does have some form of implicit conversions. To
    be more precise, you can use implicit conversions for the existing java primitives. You can assign objects of type
    Double to double typed variables as shown in the following example.
</p>

<pre class="brush: java;">
Double d = 2.0;
double d2 = d;
</pre>

<p>
    This however only works for java primitives and their associated wrapper-classes. Java does not provide any
    mechanism for declaring your own implicit methods for automated
    conversion between two non-primitive types while C# does.
