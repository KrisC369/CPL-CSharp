            <p class="lead">A discussion by socratic questioning.</p>
        </div>

        <p>For the class Gigantic Software Project Development, an assignment for groups of 3 was given to the students.
            The assignment consisted of creating a program for simulating amusements parks, while keeping in mind all of
            the safety regulations and pricing details. The implementation could be done in any programming language of
            choice. However, another part of the assignment was to fully explain why that particular programming
            language was chosen. Moe, Larry and Curley formed a team and started a discussion on which programming
            language they would be using. Bearing in mind that they should have to document exactly why they chose the
            programming language, the discussion got rather long.

        </p>

        <p id="joke"><img src="img/joke.jpg" class="img-polaroid"></p>

        <p>Moe would like to use <strong>C#</strong> as he is quite an
            expert in it. Larry on the other hand, thinks they should stick to <strong>Java</strong> as it is the
            programming
            language they know well by practicing it in other courses during the last 4 years. Curley does not really
            care what programming language is used, as long as the program can be written down easily in it. What
            follows is the discussion, where names in front of a paragraph or question depict who said what.
        </p>

        <h4>When and why was C# developed?</h4>

        <p>In 1972, a programming language called C was designed by Dennis Ritchie and in 1983 it was augmented by
            Bjarne Stroustrup with type checking and classes. This language was named C with Classes and it became
            known, along with some other new features, as C++ in 1984. The Sun Microsystems people in 1990 did not like
            C or C++, so they excluded some of the features like multiple inheritance, pointers, structs, enum types,
            operator overloading and a goto statement. Therefore making it a smaller, a simpler and especially a more
            reliable programming language called Java. Then, in July 2000, Microsoft announced the programming language
            C# because they disagreed with Sun Microsystems about the removal of all those features available in C++,
            except for multiple inheritance. Therefore, C# is very close to C++. It borrows mosts of its statements,
            keywords and operators directly from C++.
        </p>

        <p>One can thus see C# as an advance over both C++ and Java, because it offers an alternative to the difficult
            C++ programming language but also an alternative for Java programmers who are missing features of C and C++.
            Another reason for the development of C# was to provide a language for component-based software
            development.
        </p>

        <h4>So, does C# support modularity better than Java?</h4>

        <p>An important aspect of software development when talking about modularity is the ability to compartmentalize
            your code and to import different libraries.
            C# provides the functionality of referencing namespaces which are basically scopes for arbitrary sections of
            code. In Java one can import certain classes. The main difference between the using statement from c# and
            the import statement from Java is the fact that you can’t immediately use a single class in c#. You always
            have to use the namespace. To compare this with Java, a namespace looks and behaves more like a Java package
            and the using statement would correspond to the import wildcard in Java. Java imports with wildcards is
            generally frowned upon by the Java community though, as this can lead to unnecessary imports and a less
            clean dependency scheme. If you try to use the using directive on a specific class (say Card) like
            this:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: csharp;">
            using Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

        <p>
            the compiler generates the following error: “‘Sorting.Card’ is a type, not a namespace. A using namespace
            directive can only be applied to namespaces.”
            If you want to use the Card class in a C# project, than you would need to import the whole namespace
            Sorting. In java this would correspond to:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.*;
        </pre>

        <p>while in Java you can alternatively do</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

        <h4>All those preceding languages must have made influences on the C# programming language, haven’t they?</h4>

        <p>
            Indeed they did. To give you a concrete example, look at the difference in syntax when implementing an
            interface. In Java you use the implements keyword in your class declaration, because Java was influenced by
            Smalltalk. C# however uses the colon : which is close to the C++ syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not only are there direct influences from Java and C++, but also from programming languages like Delphi and
            Visual Basic. The former is because the lead designer of C# is Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish software engineer,
            and he is also known for the programming language Delphi. The latter is because Visual Basic is also a .NET
            language.
        </p>


        <p>In C# doen we het zo:</p>
        <pre class="brush: csharp;">
            public class HelloCSharp{
                public static void Main(string[] args) {
                    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
                }
            }
        </pre>

        <p>In Java doen we het zo:</p>
        <pre class="brush: java;">
            public class HelloJava {
                public static void main(String[] args){
                    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
            }
        </pre>
