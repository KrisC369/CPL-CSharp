            <p class="lead">A discussion by socratic questioning.</p>
        </div>

        <p>For the class Gigantic Software Project Development, an assignment for groups of 3 was given to the students.
            The assignment consisted of creating a program for simulating amusements parks, while keeping in mind all of
            the safety regulations and pricing details. The implementation could be done in any programming language of
            choice. However, another part of the assignment was to fully explain why that particular programming
            language was chosen. Moe, Larry and Curley formed a team and started a discussion on which programming
            language they would be using. Bearing in mind that they should have to document exactly why they chose the
            programming language, the discussion got rather long.

        </p>

        <p id="joke"><img src="img/joke.jpg" class="img-polaroid"></p>

        <p>Moe would like to use <strong>C#</strong> as he is quite an
            expert in it. Larry on the other hand, thinks they should stick to <strong>Java</strong> as it is the
            programming
            language they know well by practicing it in other courses during the last 4 years. Curley does not really
            care what programming language is used, as long as the program can be written down easily in it. What
            follows is the discussion, where names in front of a paragraph or question depict who said what.
        </p>


        <hr class="bs-docs-separator">

        <h4>When and why was C# developed?</h4>

        <p>In 1972, a programming language called C was designed by Dennis Ritchie and in 1983 it was augmented by
            Bjarne Stroustrup with type checking and classes. This language was named C with Classes and it became
            known, along with some other new features, as C++ in 1984. The Sun Microsystems people in 1990 did not like
            C or C++, so they excluded some of the features like multiple inheritance, pointers, structs, enum types,
            operator overloading and a goto statement. Therefore making it a smaller, a simpler and especially a more
            reliable programming language called Java. Then, in July 2000, Microsoft announced the programming language
            C# because they disagreed with Sun Microsystems about the removal of all those features available in C++,
            except for multiple inheritance. Therefore, C# is very close to C++. It borrows mosts of its statements,
            keywords and operators directly from C++.
        </p>

        <p>One can thus see C# as an advance over both C++ and Java, because it offers an alternative to the difficult
            C++ programming language but also an alternative for Java programmers who are missing features of C and C++.
            Another reason for the development of C# was to provide a language for component-based software
            development.
        </p>

        <h4>So, does C# support modularity better than Java?</h4>

        <p>An important aspect of software development when talking about modularity is the ability to compartmentalize
            your code and to import different libraries.
            C# provides the functionality of referencing namespaces which are basically scopes for arbitrary sections of
            code. In Java one can import certain classes. The main difference between the using statement from c# and
            the import statement from Java is the fact that you can’t immediately use a single class in c#. You always
            have to use the namespace. To compare this with Java, a namespace looks and behaves more like a Java package
            and the using statement would correspond to the import wildcard in Java. Java imports with wildcards is
            generally frowned upon by the Java community though, as this can lead to unnecessary imports and a less
            clean dependency scheme. If you try to use the using directive on a specific class (say Card) like
            this:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: csharp;">
            using Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

        <p>
            the compiler generates the following error: “‘Sorting.Card’ is a type, not a namespace. A using namespace
            directive can only be applied to namespaces.”
            If you want to use the Card class in a C# project, than you would need to import the whole namespace
            Sorting. In java this would correspond to:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.*;
        </pre>

        <p>while in Java you can alternatively do</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">
            import Sorting.Card;
        </pre>

        <h4>All those preceding languages must have made influences on the C# programming language, haven’t they?</h4>

        <p>
            Indeed they did. To give you a concrete example, look at the difference in syntax when implementing an
            interface. In Java you use the implements keyword in your class declaration, because Java was influenced by
            Smalltalk. C# however uses the colon : which is close to the C++ syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not only are there direct influences from Java and C++, but also from programming languages like Delphi and
            Visual Basic. The former is because the lead designer of C# is Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish software engineer,
            and he is also known for the programming language Delphi. The latter is because Visual Basic is also a .NET
            language.
        </p>

        <h4>For what is C# used?</h4>

        <p>
            C# is used for a variety of software, ranging from command line utilities to phone applications. The latter
            is especially the case with the release of Windows Phone in 2010. Windows Phone is a mobile operation system
            and C# is the most popular programming language to use when building apps for Windows Phone.
        </p>

        <p>
            C# is also the center language for Windows developers in general. You can make desktop applications with it.
            Here, C# distinguishes between two types of applications: Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation
            (WPF). The latter is newer than the former. Both allow to create controllers like menus and buttons, but the
            latter gives more power and flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            C# can also be used for applications in embedded systems, games and website. The latter can be defined in
            more detail into two categories. The first being the web applications and the second being the web services.
            Web applications can use the ASP.NET technology to create dynamic webpages. Powerful web services can also
            be made with C# to exchange data.
        </p>

        <p>
            But be aware. C# applications may be intended to be careful with resources such as memory and processing
            power requirements, but the language was not created in order to compete directly, on performance and size,
            with C or an assembly language.
        </p>

        <h4>Has C# changed since its initial release?</h4>

        <p>
            Like any other programming language, C# also evolved over time since its initial release, referred as C#
            1.0, in February 2002. The next version, C# 2.0, was released in November 2005 and includes features like
            generics and nullable types. Two year later, C# 3.0 was released. It mainly added functionality regarding a
            query language called Language Integrated Query (LINQ) for the .NET framework. Other examples of features in
            this update were extension and partial methods. In April 2010, C# 4.0 was released and was focused around
            interoperability. The latest version as of writing, C# 5.0, was released in August 2012 and its main
            features are asynchronous programming and caller information.
        </p>

        <h4>Are there syntax differences between Java and C#?</h4>

        <p>
            What better way to start note some syntactical differences between two programming languages than by writing
            the famous “Hello, World!” program in each of them. In C# we write:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: csharp;">
            namespace Hello {
                public class HelloInCSharp
                {
                    public static void Main(string[] args)
                    {
                        System.Console.WriteLine ("Hello, World!");
                    }
                }
            }
        </pre>

        <p>And this the Java equivalent: </p>
        <pre class="brush: java;">
            package hello;
                public class HelloInJava
                {
                    public static void main(String[] args)
                    {
                        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                    }
            }
        </pre>

        <p>
            Wait a minute, are there really noticeable differences? Indeed, C# follows the same syntax as Java, but it
            is a tiny bit different. The class declarations for this example are the same for both C# and Java.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we have a closer look at the main method, we see an uppercase m for the main method in C#, but a
            lowercase m in Java. Indeed, C# uses UpperCamelCase (also called PascalCase) for method names, while Java
            uses lowerCamelCase.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next difference is the writing of the string type. Java uses a capital letter while C# does not.
            Actually, one can write the string type in C# with a capital letter, because string is just an alias for
            System.String. Then we have the actual implementation of the main method, where we again see that C# uses
            the UpperCamelCase notation while Java uses lowerCamelCase.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last but not least, we note the difference between a namespace in C# and package in Java. In Java it is just
            one line of code, while in C# the code within that namespace is surrounded with a block.
